# Assignment Workflow

## Setup and Start
1. Create a GitHub account at [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join).
2. Access the assignment via the provided URL.
3. Log in with your GitHub account and accept the assignment.
4. Refresh the page for updates.
5. Open your assignment repository using the given link.
6. In the repository, click `<> Code` then navigate to `Codespaces`.
7. Start a new codespace by clicking `+`.
8. Wait for the codespace setup to complete.

## Working on the Assignment
1. Modify and run the code in the codespace.
2. Ignore `.devcontainer` and `.github` folders as they support the coding environment.

## Submission
1. Open `Source Control` (shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+G`).
2. Commit changes: Click `Commit`, confirm staging with `yes`, and describe your changes.
3. Finalize by clicking the `checkmark` in the top right corner.
4. Synchronize changes by pressing the `Sync Changes` button and then `OK`.

## Checking Results
1. Go back to your assignment repository.
2. Check the `Actions` tab for your commit's results.
3. Successful steps show `checkmarks`; a `cross` indicates errors (check step output for details).
