# Java Programming: A Beginner's Guide

## Overview
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language with minimal implementation dependencies. It's designed for the "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) approach, meaning Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode, which runs on any Java virtual machine (JVM).

## Popularity
Java was immensely popular post-release and remained a leading programming language. As of October 2023, it ranked fourth on the TIOBE index.

## History
Developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, Java was released in May 1995. Initially intended for interactive television, it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. Sun Microsystems released Java 1.0 in 1996, which quickly gained popularity for its security and "write once, run anywhere" functionality.

## Development and Releases
As of September 2023, the latest version is Java 21, a long-term support (LTS) version. The major release versions, along with their release dates, are detailed, starting from JDK 1.0 in January 1996 to Java SE 21 in September 2023.

## Java Editions
Java has several editions like Java Card, Java ME, Java SE, and Jakarta EE, each targeting different application environments.

## Execution System
Java's design emphasizes portability, achieved by compiling to Java bytecode. This bytecode is executed by a virtual machine, ensuring Java's platform independence.

## Oracle's Role
Post-acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009-10, Oracle Corporation has been the steward of Java technology.

## Security and Recommendations
Oracle recommends uninstalling outdated and unsupported versions of Java due to security issues in older versions.

## Java Principles
Java was created with five primary goals: simplicity, robustness, architecture-neutrality, high performance, and being interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.
